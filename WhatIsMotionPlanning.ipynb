    "### Completeness and optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "A *motion planner* is an algorithm that solves a class of motion\n",
    "planning problems. Motion planners are characterized by the class of\n",
    "problems addressed, as well as their performance in solving them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question to consider is that of *completeness*: \"will the\n",
    "planner find a path (if one exists)?\" Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Complete planner**. A planner is complete if it finds a path in finite time if one exists, *and* it\n",
    "> terminates with \"no path\" when no path exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall see in the next section that it is difficult to develop complete planners outside of relatively simple scenarios.  A relaxed version of\n",
    "completeness is *resolution-completeness*, in which the planner is\n",
    "guaranteed to find a path if one exists as some resolution parameter\n",
    "$h$, say, the size of a grid cell, approaches 0. However, if the planner\n",
    "returns \"no path\" for a given value of $h$, then we cannot tell whether\n",
    "there truly exists no path, or $h$ was not set small enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Resolution-complete planner**. A planner is resolution-complete if it accepts a resolution parameter $h>0$, such that if a path exists, it will find one in finite time given a value of $h$ made sufficiently small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another relaxed version is *probabilistic completeness*, in which the\n",
    "*likelihood* of failing to find a path, when one exists, approaches 0 as\n",
    "more time is spent planning. If such a planner returns \"no path\" after\n",
    "some amount of time, then we cannot tell whether there truly exists no\n",
    "path, or not enough time was spent planning to yield a high chance of\n",
    "finding a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Probabilistically-complete planner**. A planner is probabilistically complete if, when a path exists, then the probability that it fails to find one decreases toward 0 as more time is spent planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other property to consider that of *optimality*: \"will the planner\n",
    "find an optimal path?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Optimal planner**. An optimal planner terminates in finite time and computes the\n",
    "optimal path, if one exists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, optimal planners must also be complete, but the converse is not necessarily true. Given the difficulty of developing complete planners, we also consider relaxed versions of optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *approximately-optimal* planner will\n",
    "terminate with a path whose cost is no more than $(1+\\epsilon)$ times\n",
    "the optimal cost, where $\\epsilon > 0$ is some constant. An\n",
    "*asymptotically-optimal* planner will, given enough time, find a path\n",
    "whose cost is within a factor of $(1+\\epsilon)$ times the optimal cost\n",
    "for *any* specified value $\\epsilon > 0$. In other words, given more\n",
    "time, the planner will produce progressively better paths."
