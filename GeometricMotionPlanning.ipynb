    "Bug algorithms are simple, clever planning methods that do not actually need a map of obstacles to work!  The only pieces of information needed on-board the robot are 1) a way to determine the robot's current location $X$ and goal location $G$, 2) a contact sensor, and 3) a bit of memory.  By studying how the robot would behave in certain maps, this give us a sense of how to analyze the performance of planners. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for bug algorithms comes from the right-hand rule_ for solving mazes. If you are in a maze, a sure-fire way not to get lost is to find a wall, face a direction so that the wall is on your right, and walk along the wall while keeping it immediately to your right.  By following this process, only two possibilities may result: 1) you exit the maze, or 2) you return to the point at which you first touched the wall.  If you return to the starting point, the wall makes a closed circuit, so the next step should be to find a new portion of wall that you did not touch, and apply the right-hand rule again for that new wall.  Using this approach, you are guaranteed to explore the entire maze.  (There is no significance to right vs left; you can just as easily apply a left-hand rule.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method we will study is called Bug 1.  Unlike the case of a maze, in planning we know which direction we would need to take to reach the goal.  So, Bug 1 proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Move in a straight line path toward $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the robot reaches $G$, we are done.  \n",

    "\n",

In this example, the breakaway point is chosen more judiciously to avoid the infinite loop.  But this is only an anecdote; can we _prove_ that Bug 2 will always succeed (i.e., is a complete planner)?  It turns out that we can.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove completeness of Bug 2, we shall need to establish 3 facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. For each obstacle, Bug 2 will break away from it at some point if there is a path to the goal.\n",

    "B. The sequence of hit points decreases in distance to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. If there is no path to the goal, then Bug 2 will terminate correctly with failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $O$ be a connected, bounded, planar obstacle, and $P$ any location at which Bug 2 hits it.  Now consider the  curve $\\partial O$ traversed by the right hand rule.  This curve will be the boundary of $O$ if $O$ contains zero holes, but if $O$ contains holes then it will be some connected component of its boundary.  $\\partial O$ is a closed curve dividing the plane into two connected components, and a fact of plane geometry is that a closed curve $C$ separates two points $A \\notin C$ and $B \\notin C$ iff $\\overline{AB}$ intersects $C$ in an odd number of points.  Let $P^\\prime$ be the point immediately preceeding $P$ on the robot's path.  We know that $P^\\prime \\notin O$, and $\\|P^\\prime - G \\| > \\|P-G\\|$, because Bug 2 only moves toward the goal, never away from it.   So, if there is a path to the goal, then the line $\\overline{P^\\prime G}$ intersects $\\partial O$ an even number of times.   Hence, there is at least one other intersection point other than $P$.  Let $C$ be the closest intersection point.  The line segment between $C$ and $G$ will be pointing away from $O$, hence, we know that $C\\neq P$ since the line from $P$ to $G$ points into $O$.  Hence, the robot must break away at from $\\partial O$ at some closer point.  This establishes fact A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, let $L$ be the point at which the robot leaves obstacle $O$.  If the robot hits another obstacle, it will have traveled in a straight line from $L$ to $G$, so its next hit point $P^\\prime$ is closer to $G$ than $L$.  Since $\\|P - G \\| > \\| L - G \\| > \\|P^\\prime - G\\|$, the sequence of hit points are decreasing in distance, establishing fact B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to establish that termination at Step 5 correctly determines that no path exists.  As established in B, the sequence of hit points has decreasing distance, so an infinite loop is not possible: Bug 2 must either find the goal or terminate with \"No path\".  As established in A, \"No path\" will not be returned if there is a path to the goal. By contradiction, returning \"No path\" implies there is no path to the goal.  QED."

    "### C-space obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "For each obstacle $O$ in the workspace, there exists a corresponding set\n",
    "$\\mathcal{C}O$ called the *C-obstacle* that contains all configurations\n",
    "in which the obstacle collides with the robot. In other words,\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{C}O = \\{ q  \\in \\mathcal{C} \\quad |\\quad R(q)\\cap O \\neq \\emptyset \\}.$$\n",

    "$$\\mathcal{C} \\setminus \\mathcal{F} = \\bigcup_{O \\in E} \\mathcal{C}O.$$\n",
    "But can each $\\mathcal{C}O$ be computed? Certainly this may be a\n",
    "nontrivial problem, particularly when $dim(\\mathcal{C})$ is large,\n",
    "because it is not even clear how to represent a high dimensional set. We\n",
    "show that in some cases, we can compute C-obstacles, and in others, it\n",
    "is worth leaving a C-obstacle purely as an element of thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planar translating disks\n",
    "\n",
    "For point-robots, determining a C-obstacle is trivial. If\n",
    "$\\mathcal{C} = \\mathbb{R}^2$, and the space occupied by the robot $R(q)$\n",
    "is simply the point $\\{ q \\}$, then the C-space obstacle $\\mathcal{C}O$\n",
    "corresponding to an obstacle $O \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$ is simply\n",
    "$\\mathcal{C}O = O$ itself. Given obstacles $O_1,\\ldots,O_n$, the\n",
    "forbidden region is then simply the union $\\bigcup_{i=1}^n O_i$. If the\n",
    "obstacles overlap, we may calculate a representation of the boundary of\n",
    "the union using constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now consider the case in which the robot is a translating disk\n",
    "with radius $r$. The configuration $q$ denotes the translation of the\n",
    "robot with respect to some reference frame, and without loss of\n",
    "generality we choose this to have its origin at the center of the disk.\n",
    "Given some obstacle $O$ in workspace, the C-space obstacle\n",
    "$\\mathcal{C}O$ is the set of points such that *if the center of the disk\n",
    "is placed at that point, then the disk overlaps the obstacle.* This is\n",
    "equivalent to the set of points within radius $r$ of the obstacle:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{C}O = \\{ q \\quad |\\quad D(q,r) \\cap O \\neq \\emptyset \\| \\{ q \\quad |\\quad dist(q,O) \\leq r \\}$$\n",
    "where $D(q,r) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$ is the disk centered at $q$ with\n",

    "([Fig. 8](#fig:DiskCObstacle)). To construct the boundary, we may start\n",
    "with any vertex $u$ of the polygon, and place a point offset\n",
    "perpendicularly to its outgoing edge $\\overline{uv}$. Tracing a straight\n",

    "of the polygon until the process returns to $u$.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Minkowski sums and differences\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize the construction of C-obstacles to general translating\n",
    "robots using the notion of a Minkowski difference. The *Minkowski sum*\n",
    "$\\oplus$ is a generalization of addition to be defined on sets of\n",
    "points. If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A \\oplus B$ is defined as the\n",

    "$$A \\oplus B \\equiv \\{ x + y \\quad |\\quad x\\in A \\text{ and }y\\in B\\}.$$\n",
    "Similarly, the Minkowski difference $\\ominus$ is defined as\n",
    "$$A \\ominus B \\equiv \\{ x - y \\quad |\\quad x\\in A \\text{ and }y\\in B\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reference frame of the robot is a shape $R_0$, then the volume\n",
    "occupied after translation $q$ is the set\n",
    "$$R(q) = \\{ x \\quad |\\quad x-q \\in R_0 \\}$$ If $P$ is a workspace\n",
    "obstacle, the the condition that $R(q) \\cap O \\neq \\emptyset$ requires\n",
    "that there exists some $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $x \\in R(q)$ and\n",
    "$x \\in O$. This is equivalent to the condition that:\n",
    "$$q \\in O \\ominus R_0.$$ To see this, observe that if\n",
    "$q \\in O \\ominus R_0$, then there exists $x \\in O$ and $y \\in R_0$ such\n",
    "that $q = x - y$. In other words, $y = x-q \\in R_0$ implies that\n",
    "$x \\in R(q)$. As a result, constructing the C-obstacle is equivalent to\n",
    "compute the Minkowski difference of the object minus the robot's\n",
    "reference shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider a convex polygonal robot with reference\n",
    "$A=(a_1,\\ldots,a_m)$ and a convex polygonal obstacle\n",
    "$B = (b_1,\\ldots,b_n)$. The Minkowki sums which can be obtained by 1)\n",
    "flipping $A$ about the $x$ and $y$ axes to obtain $-A$, 2) tracing the\n",
    "flipped shape about the edges of $B$, and 3) determining the outer edges\n",
    "of the traced paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the convex case, the C-obstacle can be shown to be convex with at\n",
    "most $m+n$ edges. One brute-force way to compute it is to calculate all\n",
    "extrema $a_i + b_j$, $i=1,\\ldots,m$ and $j=1,\\ldots,n$, and then\n",
    "computing the convex hull. With an appropriate convex hull algorithm,\n",
    "this can take $O(mn \\log mn)$ time. There is however an optimal\n",
    "$O(m + n)$ algorithm that constructs the Minkowski sum. Briefly, this\n",
    "technique marches about the edges of each polygon and outputs an\n",
    "extremal vertex for each vertex of either polygon encountered in CCW\n",
    "order. In the general non-convex case, however, the Minkowski sum may\n",
    "have $O((mn)^2)$ complexity, and may have holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C-obstacles for rotational motion\n",
    "\n",
    "C-obstacles for rotational motion are much more complex. Consider, for\n",
    "example, a translating and rotating convex polygon with polygonal\n",
    "obstacles. The C-space is SE(2) and consists of configurations\n",
    "$q=(x,y,\\theta)$. Imagine it as a volume with $\\theta \\in [0,2\\pi)$ the\n",
    "vertical axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for any fixed rotation $\\theta$, if we were to consider only the\n",
    "translation components of the configuration, this would be a horizontal\n",
    "slice through configuration space. The slice of C-obstacle at height\n",
    "$\\theta$ can be determined by the Minkowski difference of the obstacle\n",

    "$$\\{ (x,y) \\quad |\\quad (x,y,\\theta) \\in \\mathcal{C}O \\} = O \\ominus R(0,0,\\theta)$$\n",
    "where $R(0,0,\\theta)$ is the rotated robot reference polygon. This is a\n",
    "convex polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we slide $\\theta$ slightly, the vertices of each slice\n",
    "rotate along a helix. At some points along the range $[0,2\\pi)$, these\n",
    "helical paths will merge or split as different combinations of obstacle\n",
    "and robot vertices enter and leave the boundary of the Minkowski\n",
    "difference. This causes the C-obstacle to become a relatively complex\n",
    "shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motion planning in SE(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although some geometric techniques have been developed for planning in\n",
    "SE(2), it is more common to adopt resolution-complete techniques to\n",
    "handle the rotational DOF. As an example, grid search can be applied\n",
    "fairly easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply grid search, the $\\theta$ dimension is split into several\n",
    "divisions on a grid over $[0,2\\pi)$, in addition to the $x$ and $y$\n",
    "dimensions. This gives a 3D grid graph that can be handled via search.\n",
    "To properly handle the topology of SO(2), vertices just below\n",
    "$\\theta=2\\pi$ are connected to the ones at $\\theta=0$. Specifically,\n",
    "suppose we have constructed a grid $(x_i,y_j,\\theta_k)$ with indices\n",
    "$i=1,\\ldots,m$, $j=1,\\ldots,n$, and $k=1,\\ldots,p$. We have\n",
    "$x_i = (i-1)\\Delta x$, $y_j=(j-1)\\Delta y$, and\n",
    "$\\theta_k= (k-1)\\Delta \\theta$, with $k=2\\pi/p$. Then, for each\n",
    "$i=1,\\ldots,m$, $j=1,\\ldots,n$ and $k=1,\\ldots,p$, the graph has an edge\n",
    "from each $(x_i,y_j,\\theta_k)$ to $(x_{i+1},y_j,\\theta_k)$ and\n",
    "$(x_i,y_{j+1},\\theta_k)$ (as long as that incremented index does not\n",
    "exceed the limit), and $(x_i,y_j,\\theta_{k+1\\mod p})$. This leads to at\n",
    "most 6 connections per vertex. Diagonal motions can also be added, which\n",
    "results in 26-connected vertices (each vertex can be thought of being in\n",
    "the center of a $3\\times 3\\times 3$ box).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when applying search, a cost function needs to be assigned to\n",
    "each edge. Because translation is measured in different units (say,\n",
    "meters) than orientation (degrees or radians), it may not make much\n",
    "sense to use Euclidean distance as the cost! As an extreme example, let\n",
    "us assume that orientation is measured in degrees and translation in\n",
    "meters, and suppose the robot would need to turn $90^\\circ$ to pass\n",
    "through a narrow gap, then rotate back $90^\\circ$ to reach a goal 1 m\n",
    "away. A planner using Euclidean distance would prefer to take a\n",
    "roundabout path (up to 180 m longer!) to get to the goal without\n",
    "reorientation. At a different extreme, let us assume that orientation is\n",
    "measured in radians and translation in millimeters. Then, the robot\n",
    "would prefer to pass through the gap even when there exists a slightly\n",
    "longer path that does not require reorientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result it is usually prudent to adopt a *weighted metric* as cost,\n",
    "such as the following:\n",
    "$$c((x,y,\\theta),(x^\\prime,y^\\prime,\\theta^\\prime)) = \\sqrt{(x-x^\\prime)^2+(y-y^\\prime)^2+w_\\theta diff(\\theta,\\theta^\\prime)^2}.$$\n",
    "Here, $diff$ is the geodesic angular distance in SO(2), and the weight\n",
    "term $w_\\theta$ should be chosen to balance the tradeoff between\n",
    "translation and rotation. One reasonable choice is to set\n",
    "$w_\\theta = R^2$ where $R$ is the radius of the robot. For axis-aligned\n",
    "motions, this weighted cost bounds the maximum distance that a point on\n",
    "the robot could move during a straight line motion\n",
    "$(x,y,\\theta)\\rightarrow (x^\\prime,y^\\prime,\\theta^\\prime)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell decomposition can also be extended in a resolution-complete fashion\n",
    "to SE(2) by splitting $\\theta$ into discrete values, and thinking of the\n",
    "$(x,y)$ plane as a \"layer\" in 3D space. The C-obstacle for that layer\n",
    "can be computed using Minkowski sums, and then its cell decomposition\n",
    "computed. Then, an edge is added to connect cells on adjacent layers\n",
    "whose $(x,y)$ projections overlap. This layered cell graph can then be\n",
    "searched to connect any two points in SE(2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path planning with curvature constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not yet described how a path could be followed. Supposing the\n",
    "robot was reasonably shaped like a disk, and could move forward and turn\n",
    "in place (e.g., a mobile robot with differential drive such as the\n",
    "iRobot Roomba, or a skid steer) any 2D polygonal path could be followed\n",
    "by a sequence of forward motions and turns. This strategy could also be\n",
    "followed by humanoid robots performing indoor navigation. If the robot\n",
    "were not disk-shaped, but could still move forward and turn in place, we\n",
    "could perform planning in SE(2) and follow the path just as easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for car-like ground vehicles and aerial vehicles, turning in\n",
    "place is not an option. The limited turning radius of the vehicle means\n",
    "that at maximum steering angle, the path follows a circular arc. No path\n",
    "of smaller turning radius is permitted (a vertex of a polygonal path can\n",
    "be thought of as a circular arc of radius 0). This places a *constraint\n",
    "on the maximum curvature* of the path. There are three general\n",
    "approaches for handling such constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Expand C-obstacles by the turning radius, and plan a path. This is\n",
    "    only appropriate if the turning radius is small compared to the size\n",
    "    of narrow passages between obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Plan paths with straight line segments connected by minimum-radius\n",
    "    arcs. The [Reeds-Shepp curves](#WhatAreDynamicsAndControl.ipynb#Dubins-car) can beextended to handle obstacle\n",
    "    avoidance in some simple cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Define a set of curvature-constrained primitive maneuvers, and\n",
    "    perform search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will expand on the latter approach, since it is quite commonly\n",
    "used for autonomous vehicles and can also be adapted to handle lane\n",
    "following and other dynamic constraints. The state lattice approach\n",
    "defines a search graph on an $(x,y\\theta)$ grid in which each connection\n",
    "corresponds to a *primitive maneuver* guaranteed to satisfy the\n",
    "curvature constraint. Each maneuver may move more than one unit along\n",
    "each axis. Usually, only a few values of $\\theta$ (4 or 8) are allowed\n",
