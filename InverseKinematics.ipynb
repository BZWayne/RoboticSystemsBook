    "### Choosing from a set of solutions: incorporating extra constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that when multiple solutions exist, neither IK\n",
    "approach specifies which solution is \"best.\" Also, it is important to\n",
    "note that many of the solutions produced by IK techniques may be\n",

    "exceed joint limits, cause the robot to self-collide, or cause the robot\n",

    "in the analytical case where multiple solutions exist, we may simply\n",
    "loop through all solutions; in the numerical case, there are some\n",
    "solution techniques that (locally) minimize $g(\\V{q})$ among possible\n",
    "solutions. To handle hard constraints in the analytical solution case,\n",
    "they may be checked after solving for all solutions. In the numerical\n",

    "additional constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter, however, additional constraints will not be\n",
    "considered unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "For *almost all* task parameters $\\V{x}$ (in a sense to be made more\n",
    "precise later) and \"usual\" kinematic structures, it is possible to\n",
    "determine the number of solutions simply by examining the number of DOFs\n",
    "of the robot and the number of constraints. Letting $n$ be the number of\n",
    "DOFs and $m$ be the number of task constraints, we have the following\n",
    "general rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If $n < m$, then no solutions to $\\V{x} = f(\\V{q})$ exist.\n",
    "    (Overconstrained system of equations)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If $n = m$, then a finite number of solutions exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If $n > m$, then either no solutions or an infinite number of\n",
    "    solutions exist. (Underconstrained system of equations)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the overconstrained case, there is insufficient flexibility in the\n",
    "choice of $\\V{q}$ to attain arbitrary values of $\\V{x}$. In the\n",
    "underconstrained case, the robot is also called *redundant*. When the\n",
    "task exceeds the reach of the robot, there is no solution, but whenever\n",
    "a solution exists, there is a *continuum* of solutions that attain the\n",
    "same task. In fact, the solution set in general will have intrinsic\n",
    "dimension $n-m$ -- that is there will be $n-m$ independent directions of\n",
    "flexibility in configuration space while maintaining the task as fixed.\n",
    "It is often the case in redundant robots that it is difficult to\n",
    "characterize all of the solutions for a given task, although we shall\n",
    "describe methods for doing so when describing parallel robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Singularities\n",
    "\n",
    "The counting rules hold almost everywhere except for certain unstable\n",
    "settings of the parameter $\\V{x}$, which are known as *singularities*.\n",
    "We have already discussed singularities in the context of 3D rotations,\n",
    "where a rotation may have multiple representations. In nonredundant IK,\n",
    "a singularity occurs when the task has an infinite number of solutions,\n",
    "or precisely one solution. In redundant IK, a singularity is observed as\n",
    "a change in the intrinsic dimensionality of the solution set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Singularities are *unstable* in the sense that any open neighborhood\n",
    "containing a singular task point $\\V{x}$ will have different numbers of\n",
    "solutions. In other words, if $\\V{x}$ were perturbed slightly, the\n",
    "number of solutions will almost certainly change. Non-singular points do\n",
    "not have this problem: for a non-singular point $\\V{x}$, there will\n",
    "exist an open neighborhood of $\\V{x}$ for which the number of solutions\n",
    "remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, singularities usually avoided during IK for a number\n",
    "of reasons: as a singularity is approached in task space, the the\n",
    "solution configurations change increasingly rapidly, and the solution\n",
    "set may change size, making it challenging to produce smooth movements.\n",
    "There is a straightforward way of computing whether a configuration is\n",
    "at a singularity via a condition about the task's *Jacobian matrix*.\n",
    "This will be discussed in the [section on Jacobians](#the-jacobian-matrix)."

    "\n",

    "orientation components can also be computed in a straightforward manner.\n",
    "The orientation Jacobian $J_\\theta$ converts joint velocities into the\n",

    "effector equally. Hence, each column of $J_\\theta$ corresponding to a\n",
    "revolute joint is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 3D, an angular velocity vector is a vector $\\V{\\omega}$ such that for\n",
    "any point $\\V{x}$ expressed in world coordinates but attached to link\n",
    "$n$, its instantaneous velocity will be:\n",
    "$$\\V{\\omega}\\times (\\V{x} - \\V{t}_n) + \\dot{\\V{t}}_n$$ where $\\V{t}_n$\n",
    "is the origin of link $n$. Hence, the angular velocity at the end\n",
    "effector is simply the angular velocity of link $n$. The angular\n",

    "the multiplication orients the local axis to the world coordinate frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that $\\V{\\omega}$ is usually not the derivative\n",
    "of a given rotation representation, like Euler angles. Instead, it is\n",

    "### Significance and interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relating joint and task velocities\n",
    "\n",
    "The general formula relating joint space velocities to task space\n",
    "velocities is: $$\\dot{\\V{x}} = J(\\V{q}) \\dot{\\V{q}}$$ where $J$ is the\n",
    "Jacobian of the task space map. In other words, the $i$'th column of $J$\n",
    "gives the velocity at which the end effector would move if the $i$'th\n",
    "joint were to move at unit velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As a Taylor expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interpretation of the Jacobian is as an $n$-dimensional analogue\n",
    "of Taylor expansion. Recall that the 1st order Taylor expansion of a\n",
    "normal 1-D, differentiable function is the linear approximation:\n",
    "$$f(x + \\Delta x) = f(x) + f^\\prime(x)\\cdot \\Delta x + O(\\Delta x^2)$$\n",
    "where $O(h^2)$ denotes a term smaller than a constant times $h^2$ as $h$\n",
    "decreases asymptotically to 0. This means that a function is\n",
    "increasingly better approximated with the line\n",
    "$y = f(x) + \\Delta x f^\\prime(x)$ as $\\Delta x$ shrinks toward 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jacobian appears in the $n$-dimensional Taylor expansion of a\n",
    "multidimensional differentiable function:\n",
    "$$f(\\V{x} + \\Delta \\V{x}) = f(\\V{x}) + J(\\V{x}) \\Delta \\V{x} + O(\\|\\Delta \\V{x}\\|^2).$$\n",
    "This states that an arbitrary function is well-approximated as a\n",
    "hyperplane $$\\V{y} = f(\\V{x}) + J(\\V{x}) \\Delta \\V{x}$$ as\n",
    "$\\Delta \\V{x}$ shrinks toward 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use in error propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important use of the Jacobian is in error propagation. Suppose\n",
    "that at a robot has configuration $\\V{q}$ but with a joint space error\n",
    "$\\V{\\epsilon}$. Then the task-space error\n",
    "$$f(\\V{q}+\\V{\\epsilon}) - f(\\V{q})$$ is approximated by the Taylor\n",
    "expansion\n",
    "$$f(\\V{q}+\\V{\\epsilon}) - f(\\V{q}) \\approx J(\\V{q}) \\V{\\epsilon}$$ if\n",
    "$\\epsilon$ is small. In terms of absolute magnitude, the task space\n",
    "error is $\\| J(\\V{q}) \\V{\\epsilon}\\|$. We can also bound the error:\n",
    "$$\\| J(\\V{q}) \\V{\\epsilon}\\| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^n |\\epsilon_i| \\|J_i(\\V{q})\\|$$\n",
    "where $J_i$ is the $i$'th column of the Jacobian. As a result if joint\n",
    "$i$ had an error, the norm of $J_i$ approximates the corresponding error\n",
    "in task space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, in $n$R planar robots, the $i$'th column of the Jacobian is\n",
    "simply the vector from the $i$'th joint to the end effector, rotated by\n",
    "$90^\\circ$ CCW. This has the significance that if the end effector is\n",
    "farther from revolute joint $i$ than joint $j$, then the magnitude of\n",
    "the $i$'th column is greater than the magnitude of the $j$'th column.\n",
    "Usually, this means that errors and movements of joints close to the\n",
    "robot's base have a larger effect than joints closer to the end\n",

    "#### Derivation from Taylor Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 1D function $f(x)$, Newton's method repeatedly approximates the\n",
    "curve at an iterate $x_i$ as a line through $(x_i,f(x_i))$ using Taylor\n",

    "invertible. The matrix is invertible as long as the robot is not at a\n",

    "$$\\V{q}_{i+1} = \\V{q}_i + \\alpha_i \\Delta \\V{q}_i$$ is taken, with\n",
    "$\\alpha_i > 0$ a parameter chosen at each step. The step size is usually\n",
    "taken to obtain a sufficient decrease in the error function value. One\n",

    "at a local minimum, or a numerical error has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is to penalize steps that are too large in the\n",

    "function with a small cost term: $\\|f(\\V{q})\\|^2 + \\epsilon g(\\V{q})$.\n",
    "The drawback of this approach is that if $\\epsilon$ is too large, the\n",
    "optimum of the augmented objective will no longer meet the task\n",
    "constraint, but if it is too small then it will not significantly affect\n",
    "the descent direction. In root finding methods, the direction of each\n",
    "step can be optimized in the null space of the task Jacobian to move in\n",
    "the gradient descent direction $-\\nabla g(\\V{q})$ while also respecting\n",
    "the constraint. Specifically, the null space projection is given by\n",
    "$-(I - J^+ J ) \\nabla g(\\V{q})$ which can be added onto the step\n",
    "direction (with some scaling factor).\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest type of hard constraint to incorporate is joint limits,\n",
    "where each joint $q_i$ is limited to the range $[a_i,b_i]$. In numerical\n",
    "methods each iterate can be limited to the hyper-box\n",
    "$[a_1,b_1] \\times \\cdots \\times [a_n,b_n]$ simply by projecting each\n",
    "joint value into its range. For even faster convergence when a joint is\n",
    "meeting its joint limit, higher order methods (Newton-Raphson, Newton,\n",
    "and Quasi-Newton methods) will eliminate the direction of motion from\n",
    "consideration when determining the step size. In Newton-Raphson, this is\n",
    "done by setting the column of the Jacobian matrix corresponding to\n",
    "constrained joints to zero before before computing the pseudoinverse. In\n",
    "Newton and Quasi-Newton optimization, both the row and column of the\n",
    "Hessian matrix are eliminated before inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex constraints, such as obstacle avoidance, may be expressed\n",
    "in the form $h(\\V{q}) \\leq 0$, but are harder to accommodate. It is not\n",

    "optimizing, since it will very likely be infeasible. More sophisticated\n",
    "constrained optimization models, like nonlinear programming, express all\n",
    "constraints simultaneously and solve them using more advanced methods\n",
    "like sequential quadratic programming. Such methods are outside of the\n",
    "scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local minimum issues\n",
    "\n",
    "All numerical methods presented above suffer from the issue of *local\n",
    "minima*, in which the error cannot be reduced with local movements, but\n",
    "instead a large step is needed to make progress toward a solution.\n",
    "Imagining an error \"landscape\", the landscape may potentially have many\n",
    "peaks and valleys, and one valley will contain the true optimal\n",
    "solution. When an iterate is near a local minimum, the method would need\n",
    "to choose a step direction to jump out of the local minimum. However,\n",
    "such a direction is not obvious from local information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is indeed a problem with numerical IK techniques, particularly in\n",
    "the presence of joint limits, because in practice, some significant\n",
    "fraction of seed configurations will not converge to a solution. The\n",
    "problem of finding a global solution is known as *global optimization*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CCD + Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, CCD rarely falls into local minima, so an effective\n",
    "solution would be to combine CCD to get relatively close to an optimum,\n",
    "with some other optimization technique for the final convergence steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random restarts\n",
    "\n",
    "Another effective technique is known as *random restart* optimization.\n",
    "In this method, if the initial seed fails to yield a solution after\n",
    "local optimization, then a new seed is picked at random. This restart\n",
    "process is repeated up to $N$ times or until a solution is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the fraction of seed configurations that lead to failure is $p$, then\n",
    "the probability that this method leads to a failure is $p^N$, which is\n",
    "quite small for large $N$. In fact, the expected number of restarts\n",
    "needed to find a solution is $1/p$. The main drawback of random restarts\n",
    "is when the task is infeasible, then the entirety of the $N$ random\n",
    "restarts is required, which may be computationally expensive if $N$ is\n",
    "large.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulated Annealing\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is simulated annealing, which uses random jumps in\n",
    "configuration space and accepts error-increasing steps with some\n",
    "probability. This and other related methods, like evolutionary\n",
    "algorithms, are known as metaheuristics, and can lead to high-quality\n",
    "solutions where other techniques fail. However, in practice, these\n",
    "techniques are much slower to converge than competing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IK Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "The final approach we will mention is a data-driven method. First, in a\n",
    "preprocessing step, IK solutions are tabulated for a large number of\n",
    "points in task space, computed exhaustively using some other global\n",
    "optimization method. Then, when a new IK problem is queried, the nearest\n",
    "task point to the query point is retrieved, and the prior solution is\n",
    "used as a seed. When a large number of solutions have been previously\n",
    "computed, the retrieved solution is likely to be very close to the\n",
    "globally optimal solution to the new problem."

    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming task spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue we have not yet addressed is how to define IK problems on a\n",
    "computer rather than mathematically. This is not so much of a problem\n",
    "with analytical methods --- you have spent hours deriving the solution\n",
    "and coding it up so you know exactly what the inputs and outputs need to\n",
    "be. But the strength of numerical methods is that you can very easily\n",
    "change the IK problem you'd like to solve. If your robot is supposed to\n",
    "pick up a cup, hold it upright during transit, and then place it\n",
    "somewhere on a table, you will need to solve three entirely different IK\n",
    "problems! How should they be specified?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each IK software library has some data structure to specify a primitive\n",
    "*task*, which is usually a Cartesian goal for one link of the robot. So,\n",
    "in basic form a task is specified by a link index $L$, and a desired\n",
    "rigid transform $T_L$ (from link to world coordinates). However, the\n",
    "user can configure which Cartesian components should be included to\n",
    "obtain different effects. The typical types of tasks available are\n",
    "position only, position and orientation, or orientation only. More\n",
    "sophisticated tasks may include position about some axes, orientation of\n",
    "some axis, or some combination of the two. These are enabled or disabled\n",
    "according to various flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking our cup-picking problem as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To pick up a cup, the robot's hand should be constrained to a\n",
    "    position $\\V{x}_G$ and orientation $R_G$ so that it makes contact\n",
    "    with the cup (a grasp pose). This would be a *fixed* constraint,\n",
    "    with a 6D task space.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Next, while keeping the cup oriented upward, the orientation of the\n",
    "    hand about the $z$ axis should be kept constant. This means that our\n",
    "    constraint is the $z$ axis in the hand's local frame, $R_G^T \\V{z}$,\n",
    "    should be matched to $\\V{z}$ in world coordinates. Since we don't\n",
    "    care about position, and we don't care how the robot rotates about\n",
    "    $z$, this would be an *axis* constraint, which has a 2D task space.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Finally, while putting the cup down on a flat surface, we don't care\n",
    "    too much about where on the surface the cup gets placed, but we do\n",
    "    need the cup to stay upright and the bottom of the cup to be at a\n",
    "    height $z_S$. So, we need to include the prior orientation\n",
    "    constraint, plus an additional 1D position constraint. To implement\n",
    "    this, we can compute one point on the bottom of the cup in local\n",
    "    coordinates of the hand. Let's say we recorded such a point\n",
    "    $\\V{x}_B$ in world coordinates back when we first picked up the cup.\n",
    "    In hand-local coordinates, this point is $R_G^T(\\V{x}_B - \\V{x}_G)$.\n",
    "    Now, the new world coordinates of this point need to be at height\n",
    "    $z_S$, which is a *plane* constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement an axis constraint, a local direction $\\V{d}_L$ is matched\n",
    "to a world direction $\\V{d}_D$. Such a constraint can be specified with\n",
    "a flag and either 1) $\\V{d}_L$, $\\V{d}_D$, or 2) $T_L$ and either\n",
    "direction (the other quantity can be derived from $T_L$).\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a plane constraint, $T_L$ and the normal to the plane in\n",
    "world coordinates $\\V{n}$ must be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support of these various tasks is mixed in various software packages.\n",
    "Klamp't supports arbitrary numbers of tasks, each of which can have\n",
    "position and orientation components enabled or disabled. The data\n",
    "structure that specifies each task is called an IKObjective. Orocos KDL\n",
    "only supports tasks that define a full Cartesian transform of a link.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenRAVE ikfast module supports several task types, each of which\n",
    "constrains some combination position and orientation components (11 as\n",
    "of time of writing). This module is noteworthy in that it provides a\n",
    "method to derive analytic IK expressions for your robot; after a few\n",
    "minutes to an hour of computation, it generates code that can be\n",
    "compiled to solve IK problems very quickly (and exhaustively). It does\n",
    "require that you know your task spaces well in advance, and it does\n",
    "sometimes fail to generate expressions for certain kinematic structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Using IK can be fraught with bugs if used carelessly. Usually when an\n",
    "engineer uses IK, he/she is trying to program a high-level specification\n",
    "of some application as quickly as possible, and can quickly gloss over\n",
    "*whether enough information is available* to employ IK properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us recap all of the items necessary to employ IK on a robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The robot's kinematic structure is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The coordinates of the tool center point are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The coordinate frame of the end effector link is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A rotation matrix defining the desired orientation of the end\n",
    "    effector link is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   All coordinates are given with respect to the assumed reference\n",
    "    frame (and units) of the solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minor positioning errors can occur if any of these values are not\n",
    "properly *calibrated*, i.e., measured to high accuracy. We will revisit\n",
    "calibration a later chapter. However, major errors can result if\n",
    "reference coordinate frames are misunderstood or interpreted\n",
    "incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the reference frame of the end effector link has\n",
    "the gripper fingers pointing in the $z$ direction and open by traveling\n",
    "along the $x$ axis direction. But, suppose the programmer assumed that\n",
    "fingers point in the $x$ direction and $z$ is the local axis as though\n",
    "the robot were picking up a cup. Then by specifying the identity matrix\n",
    "as the end effector orientation, --- a seemingly sensible orientation to\n",
    "lift a cup with this mistaken frame convention --- the programmer will\n",
    "have asked the robot to grab the cup with fingers pointing straight\n",
    "upward! This is why it is so important to adopt strict and explicit\n",
    "coordinate conventions, and also to test in simulation. Now, a careless\n",
    "programmer might test the solver on the real robot\\... and if the IK\n",
    "solver succeeds, then the robot will be driven straight through the\n",
    "table! It is much better to start in simulation: ideally the IK solver\n",
    "will succeed with a bizarre configuration, suggesting a bug. If the IK\n",
    "solver fails, the programmer needs to do more digging to discover the\n",
    "root of the problem. To help this, visualization tools can be used in\n",
    "the process of *visual debugging* to inspect reference frames and\n",
    "variables in a more intuitive way than looking at numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if analytical IK is being used, the following must also hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The task space defined by the IK subroutine match that of your\n",
    "    application.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The robot structure matches that assumed by the IK subroutine\n",
    "    (including joint axes, link frame conventions, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Joint values are 0 at the robot's assumed reference position.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The first joint (or the first set of intersecting joints) of the\n",
    "    robot is at the origin of the world frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these do not hold, it is the responsibility of the user of the\n",
    "subroutine to calculate the appropriate Cartesian transformations to\n",
    "transform the input appropriately, and to apply the appropriate joint\n",
    "offsets to transform the output appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IK and Movement\n",
    "\n",

    "Section [1.7](#sec:CartesianTrajectories){reference-type=\"ref\"\n",
