    "$\\| f(\\V{q}) - \\V{x}_D \\|$ approaches 0. This section will focus on\n",
    "analytical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of the analytical method include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Computes all IK solutions, and determines whether no solution\n",
    "    exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Once the equations are derived, solutions are very fast to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   No need to define solution parameters or initial guesses $\\V{q}_0$\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Often difficult or tedious to derive.\n",

    "    structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Only applicable to nonredundant robots (\\# DOFs = \\# of task space\n",
    "    dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing from a set of solutions: incorporating extra constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that when multiple solutions exist, neither IK\n",
    "approach specifies which solution is \"best.\" Also, it is important to\n",
    "note that many of the solutions produced by IK techniques may be\n",
    "infeasible for a robot to undertake. For example, IK solutions may\n",
    "exceed joint limits, cause the robot to self-collide, or cause the robot\n",
    "to collide with environmental obstacles. In fact, the notion of \"best\"\n",
    "or \"feasible\" must be defined by some criterion external to the choice\n",
    "of task. The requirement of producing high-quality solutions can be\n",
    "considered as a *soft constraint*, while strict requirements are\n",
    "considered *hard constraints*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soft constraints can be expressed as seeking an IK solution that\n",
    "minimizes some scalar function $g(\\V{q})$. To handle soft constraints,\n",
    "in the analytical case where multiple solutions exist, we may simply\n",
    "loop through all solutions; in the numerical case, there are some\n",
    "solution techniques that (locally) minimize $g(\\V{q})$ among possible\n",
    "solutions. To handle hard constraints in the analytical solution case,\n",
    "they may be checked after solving for all solutions. In the numerical\n",
    "case, it is preferable to use solution techniques that enforce these\n",
    "additional constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter, however, additional constraints will not be\n",
    "considered unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "For *almost all* task parameters $\\V{x}$ (in a sense to be made more\n",
    "precise later) and \"usual\" kinematic structures, it is possible to coarsely\n",
    "determine the number of solutions simply by examining the number of DOFs\n",
    "of the robot and the number of constraints. Letting $n$ be the number of\n",
    "DOFs and $m$ be the number of task constraints, we have the following\n",
    "general rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If $n < m$, then no solutions to $\\V{x} = f(\\V{q})$ exist.\n",
    "    (Overconstrained system of equations)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If $n = m$, then a finite number of solutions exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If $n > m$, then either no solutions or an infinite number of\n",
    "    solutions exist. (Underconstrained system of equations)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the overconstrained case, there is insufficient flexibility in the\n",
    "choice of $\\V{q}$ to attain arbitrary values of $\\V{x}$. In the\n",
    "underconstrained case, the robot is also called *redundant*. When the\n",
    "task exceeds the reach of the robot, there is no solution, but whenever\n",
    "a solution exists, there is a *continuum* of solutions that attain the\n",
    "same task. In fact, the solution set in general will have intrinsic\n",
    "dimension $n-m$ -- that is there will be $n-m$ independent directions of\n",
    "flexibility in configuration space while maintaining the task as fixed.\n",
    "It is often the case in redundant robots that it is difficult to\n",
    "characterize all of the solutions for a given task, although we shall\n",
    "describe methods for doing so when describing parallel robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Singularities\n",
    "\n",
    "The counting rules hold almost everywhere except for certain unstable\n",
    "settings of the parameter $\\V{x}$, which are known as *singularities*.\n",
    "We have already discussed singularities in the context of 3D rotations,\n",
    "where a rotation may have multiple representations. In nonredundant IK,\n",
    "a singularity occurs when the task has an infinite number of solutions,\n",
    "or precisely one solution. In redundant IK, a singularity is observed as\n",
    "a change in the intrinsic dimensionality of the solution set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Singularities are *unstable* in the sense that any open neighborhood\n",
    "containing a singular task point $\\V{x}$ will have different numbers of\n",
    "solutions. In other words, if $\\V{x}$ were perturbed slightly, the\n",
    "number of solutions will almost certainly change. Non-singular points do\n",
    "not have this problem: for a non-singular point $\\V{x}$, there will\n",
    "exist an open neighborhood of $\\V{x}$ for which the number of solutions\n",
    "remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, singularities usually avoided during IK for a number\n",
    "of reasons: as a singularity is approached in task space, the the\n",
    "solution configurations change increasingly rapidly, and the solution\n",
    "set may change size, making it challenging to produce smooth movements.\n",
    "There is a straightforward way of computing whether a configuration is\n",
    "at a singularity via a condition about the task's *Jacobian matrix*.\n",
    "This will be discussed in the [section on Jacobians](#The-Jacobian-matrix)."

    "#### Orientation jacobians\n",
    "\n",
    "For task spaces that include orientation components, the Jacobian of the\n",
    "orientation components can also be computed in a straightforward manner.\n",
    "The orientation Jacobian $J_\\theta$ converts joint velocities into the\n",
    "angular velocity of the link containing the end effector. In 2D, angular\n",
    "velocity is simply a scalar and hence $J_\\theta$ is a $1\\times n$\n",
    "matrix. In 3D, angular velocity is a 3D vector, and hence $J_\\theta$ is\n",
    "a $3 \\times n$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, any prismatic joints do not affect orientation, and hence the\n",
    "columns of the orientation Jacobian corresponding to such joints are\n",
    "zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For revolute joints in 2D, each joint affects the orientation of the end\n",
    "effector equally. Hence, each column of $J_\\theta$ corresponding to a\n",
    "revolute joint is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 3D, an angular velocity vector is a vector $\\V{\\omega}$ such that for\n",
    "any point $\\V{x}$ expressed in world coordinates but attached to link\n",
    "$n$, its instantaneous velocity will be:\n",
    "$$\\V{\\omega}\\times (\\V{x} - \\V{t}_n) + \\dot{\\V{t}}_n$$ where $\\V{t}_n$\n",
    "is the origin of link $n$. Hence, the angular velocity at the end\n",
    "effector is simply the angular velocity of link $n$. The angular\n",
    "velocity of each revolute joint are summed to obtain the angular\n",

    "It is important to note that $\\V{\\omega}$ is usually not the derivative\n",

    "### Significance and interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relating joint and task velocities\n",
    "\n",
    "The general formula relating joint space velocities to task space\n",
    "velocities is: $$\\dot{\\V{x}} = J(\\V{q}) \\dot{\\V{q}}$$ where $J$ is the\n",
    "Jacobian of the task space map. In other words, the $i$'th column of $J$\n",
    "gives the velocity at which the end effector would move if the $i$'th\n",
    "joint were to move at unit velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As a Taylor expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interpretation of the Jacobian is as an $n$-dimensional analogue\n",
    "of Taylor expansion. Recall that the 1st order Taylor expansion of a\n",
    "normal 1-D, differentiable function is the linear approximation:\n",
    "$$f(x + \\Delta x) = f(x) + f^\\prime(x)\\cdot \\Delta x + O(\\Delta x^2)$$\n",
    "where $O(h^2)$ denotes a term smaller than a constant times $h^2$ as $h$\n",
    "decreases asymptotically to 0. This means that a function is\n",
    "increasingly better approximated with the line\n",
    "$y = f(x) + \\Delta x f^\\prime(x)$ as $\\Delta x$ shrinks toward 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jacobian appears in the $n$-dimensional Taylor expansion of a\n",
    "multidimensional differentiable function:\n",
    "$$f(\\V{x} + \\Delta \\V{x}) = f(\\V{x}) + J(\\V{x}) \\Delta \\V{x} + O(\\|\\Delta \\V{x}\\|^2).$$\n",
    "This states that an arbitrary function is well-approximated as a\n",
    "hyperplane $$\\V{y} = f(\\V{x}) + J(\\V{x}) \\Delta \\V{x}$$ as\n",
    "$\\Delta \\V{x}$ shrinks toward 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use in error propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important use of the Jacobian is in error propagation. Suppose\n",
    "that at a robot has configuration $\\V{q}$ but with a joint space error\n",
    "$\\V{\\epsilon}$. Then the task-space error\n",
    "$$f(\\V{q}+\\V{\\epsilon}) - f(\\V{q})$$ is approximated by the Taylor\n",
    "expansion\n",
    "$$f(\\V{q}+\\V{\\epsilon}) - f(\\V{q}) \\approx J(\\V{q}) \\V{\\epsilon}$$ if\n",
    "$\\epsilon$ is small. In terms of absolute magnitude, the task space\n",
    "error is $\\| J(\\V{q}) \\V{\\epsilon}\\|$. We can also bound the error:\n",
    "$$\\| J(\\V{q}) \\V{\\epsilon}\\| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^n |\\epsilon_i| \\|J_i(\\V{q})\\|$$\n",
    "where $J_i$ is the $i$'th column of the Jacobian. As a result if joint\n",
    "$i$ had an error, the norm of $J_i$ approximates the corresponding error\n",
    "in task space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, in $n$R planar robots, the $i$'th column of the Jacobian is\n",
    "simply the vector from the $i$'th joint to the end effector, rotated by\n",
    "$90^\\circ$ CCW. This has the significance that if the end effector is\n",
    "farther from revolute joint $i$ than joint $j$, then the magnitude of\n",
    "the $i$'th column is greater than the magnitude of the $j$'th column.\n",
    "Usually, this means that errors and movements of joints close to the\n",

    "### Incorporating other constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Soft preferences, such as minimizing $g(\\V{q})$ can designate other\n",
    "desired criteria to be achieved in redundant systems. In minimization\n",
    "methods, preferences can be formulated by augmenting the objective\n",
    "function with a small cost term: $\\|f(\\V{q})\\|^2 + \\epsilon g(\\V{q})$.\n",
    "The drawback of this approach is that if $\\epsilon$ is too large, the\n",
    "optimum of the augmented objective will no longer meet the task\n",

    "the descent direction. In root finding methods, the direction of each\n",
    "step can be optimized in the null space of the task Jacobian to move in\n",
    "the gradient descent direction $-\\nabla g(\\V{q})$ while also respecting\n",
    "the constraint. Specifically, the null space projection is given by\n",
    "$-(I - J^+ J ) \\nabla g(\\V{q})$ which can be added onto the step\n",
    "direction (with some scaling factor).\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest type of hard constraint to incorporate is joint limits,\n",
    "where each joint $q_i$ is limited to the range $[a_i,b_i]$. In numerical\n",
    "methods each iterate can be limited to the hyper-box\n",

    "\n",

    "instead a large step is needed to make progress toward a solution.\n",
    "Imagining an error \"landscape\", the landscape may potentially have many\n",

    "needed to find a solution is $1/p$. The main drawback of random restarts\n",

    "large.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulated annealing\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is simulated annealing, which uses random jumps in\n",

    "probability. This and other related methods, like evolutionary\n",
    "algorithms, are known as metaheuristics, and can lead to high-quality\n",

    "with analytical methods --- you have spent hours deriving the solution\n",
    "and coding it up so you know exactly what the inputs and outputs need to\n",
    "be. But the strength of numerical methods is that you can very easily\n",
    "change the IK problem you'd like to solve. If your robot is supposed to\n",
    "pick up a cup, hold it upright during transit, and then place it\n",
    "somewhere on a table, you will need to solve three entirely different IK\n",
    "problems! How should they be specified?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each IK software library has some data structure to specify a primitive\n",
    "*task*, which is usually a Cartesian goal for one link of the robot. So,\n",
    "in basic form a task is specified by a link index $L$, and a desired\n",
    "rigid transform $T_L$ (from link to world coordinates). However, the\n",
    "user can configure which Cartesian components should be included to\n",
    "obtain different effects. The typical types of tasks available are\n",

    "sophisticated tasks may include position about some axes, orientation of\n",
    "some axis, or some combination of the two. These are enabled or disabled\n",
    "according to various flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking our cup-picking problem as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To pick up a cup, the robot's hand should be constrained to a\n",
    "    position $\\V{x}_G$ and orientation $R_G$ so that it makes contact\n",

    "    $z$, this would be an *axis* constraint, which has a 2D task space.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Finally, while putting the cup down on a flat surface, we don't care\n",
    "    too much about where on the surface the cup gets placed, but we do\n",
    "    need the cup to stay upright and the bottom of the cup to be at a\n",
    "    height $z_S$. So, we need to include the prior orientation\n",
    "    constraint, plus an additional 1D position constraint. To implement\n",
    "    this, we can compute one point on the bottom of the cup in local\n",
    "    coordinates of the hand. Let's say we recorded such a point\n",
    "    $\\V{x}_B$ in world coordinates back when we first picked up the cup.\n",
    "    In hand-local coordinates, this point is $R_G^T(\\V{x}_B - \\V{x}_G)$.\n",
    "    Now, the new world coordinates of this point need to be at height\n",
    "    $z_S$, which is a *plane* constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement an axis constraint, a local direction $\\V{d}_L$ is matched\n",
    "to a world direction $\\V{d}_D$. Such a constraint can be specified with\n",
    "a flag and either 1) $\\V{d}_L$, $\\V{d}_D$, or 2) $T_L$ and either\n",
    "direction (the other quantity can be derived from $T_L$).\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a plane constraint, $T_L$ and the normal to the plane in\n",

    "sometimes fail to generate expressions for certain kinematic structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Using IK can be fraught with bugs if used carelessly. Usually when an\n",
    "engineer uses IK, he/she is trying to program a high-level specification\n",
    "of some application as quickly as possible, and can quickly gloss over\n",
    "*whether enough information is available* to employ IK properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us recap all of the items necessary to employ IK on a robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The robot's kinematic structure is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The coordinates of the tool center point are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The coordinate frame of the end effector link is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A rotation matrix defining the desired orientation of the end\n",
    "    effector link is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   All coordinates are given with respect to the assumed reference\n",
    "    frame (and units) of the solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minor positioning errors can occur if any of these values are not\n",
    "properly *calibrated*, i.e., measured to high accuracy. We will revisit\n",
    "calibration a later chapter. However, major errors can result if\n",
    "reference coordinate frames are misunderstood or interpreted\n",
    "incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the reference frame of the end effector link has\n",
    "the gripper fingers pointing in the $z$ direction and open by traveling\n",
    "along the $x$ axis direction. But, suppose the programmer assumed that\n",
    "fingers point in the $x$ direction and $z$ is the local axis as though\n",
    "the robot were picking up a cup. Then by specifying the identity matrix\n",
    "as the end effector orientation, --- a seemingly sensible orientation to\n",
    "lift a cup with this mistaken frame convention --- the programmer will\n",
    "have asked the robot to grab the cup with fingers pointing straight\n",
    "upward! This is why it is so important to adopt strict and explicit\n",
    "coordinate conventions, and also to test in simulation. Now, a careless\n",
    "programmer might test the solver on the real robot\\... and if the IK\n",
    "solver succeeds, then the robot will be driven straight through the\n",
    "table! It is much better to start in simulation: ideally the IK solver\n",
    "will succeed with a bizarre configuration, which, upon inspection, suggests a bug. If the IK\n",
    "solver fails, the programmer needs to do more digging to discover the\n",
    "root of the problem. To help this, visualization tools can be used in\n",
    "the process of *visual debugging* to inspect reference frames and\n",
    "variables in a more intuitive way than looking at numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if analytical IK is being used, the following must also hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The task space defined by the IK subroutine match that of your\n",
    "    application.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The robot structure matches that assumed by the IK subroutine\n",
    "    (including joint axes, link frame conventions, etc.)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "IK is commonly used in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To determine an endpoint for a motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To move a robot's end effector along a given task space path, such as a straight line in workspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Case 1, we may simply determine a desired joint space value $q_D$ that matches the end effector\n",
    "$\\V{x}(q_D)$ maps to the task space coordinates $\\V{x}_D$.  Then, the robot can move from the current value\n",
    "of $q$ to $q_D$ in a straight line in joint space. However, as [we have seen before](#Nonlinear-mapping-between-C-space-and-workspace),\n",
    "such a motion does not usually move in a straight line in workspace due to the nonlinearity of forward kinematics.  If we want the end effector to move in a designated Cartesian trajectory, then we must be more careful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2 is a *Cartesian path following* problem, which asks to generate a trajectory $q(t)$ so that $\\V{x}(q(t)) = \\V{x}_D(t)$ for $t\\in[0,1]$.  It may be tempting to simply write an algorithm like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "*************\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"alg:NaivePathFollowing\">Algorithm 1</a>. **Naive Cartesian path following**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let $q_0$ be the current configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For** $i=1,\\ldots,N$:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let $t=i/N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a IK solver to find $q$ satisfying $\\V{x}(q) = \\V{x}_D(t)$, picking the solution closest to $q_{i-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$q_i \\gets q$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return** the joint space path connecting $q_0,q_1,\\ldots,q_N$\n",
    "\n",
    "*************\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in step 4, a numerical IK method may simply use $q_{i-1}$ as the initial seed.  An analytical method for a nonredundant robot should enumerate all solutions and pick the closest one.  The choice of the resolution $N$ is also important, because it will determine how closely $\\V{x}(q(t))$ tracks the desired trajectory.  For example, if a long screw needs to be drilled along a precise path, a very fine resolution will be needed.  In fact, industrial robot controllers will solve these problems at or near the control frequency (several hundreds of times per second)\n",

    "\n",
    "2.  Picking an IK solution that causes collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Passing through or near singularities, causing the desired joint\n",
    "    velocities to exceed their limits\n",

    "1.  Consider a planar \"spider robot\" with 3 arms, each consisting of a\n",
    "    2R manipulator, connected at a center point. Each of the \"hands\"\n",
    "    (end effectors of each arm) must be placed at locations\n",
    "    $\\V{x}_1,\\V{x}_2,\\V{x}_3$, respectively. Define a configuration\n",
    "    space of the robot. What is the task space of the IK constraints?\n",
    "    What is the intrinsic dimension of the self-motion manifold? For\n",
    "    what values of $\\V{x}_1,\\V{x}_2,\\V{x}_3$ would the solution space be\n",
    "    empty?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Derive an analytical IK solution for a 3R planar manipulator with\n",
    "    both position and orientation tasks. Hint: start by considering the\n",
    "    desired location of the third joint, and use the planar 2R solution\n",
    "    to place the third joint there.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Derive an analytical IK solution for the 3R 3D manipulator (ZYY) in\n",
    "    the general case where the end effector has local coordinates\n",
    "    $\\V{x}_3$ on the third link, and the task is to place the end\n",
    "    effector at coordinates $\\V{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Derive the configuration space for a closed 4-bar linkage with link\n",
    "    lengths $L_1,\\ldots,L_4$, assuming the first bar is fixed in world\n",
    "    coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Perform error propagation to derive an expression relating joint\n",
    "    space error to the maximum possible Cartesian end effector\n",
    "    positioning error of an $n$R planar serial robot with unit length\n",
    "    links. At what configurations is the maximum error achieved?\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  (Implementation) Experimentally evaluate how often a numerical IK solver falls into\n",
    "    local minima on a 6DOF manipulator. (For example, use the\n",
    "    `puma760.rob` or `tx90l.rob` model in Klamp't) To do so, sample some\n",
    "    number of reachable end effector transforms by sampling a\n",
    "    configuration at random. Then, for each of those transforms, and\n",
    "    attempt numerical IK using a seed configuration sampled at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  (Implementation) Implement the naive Cartesian path following algorithm\n",
    "    for a simple robot (the 2R robot, for example).  Give it an input path $\\V{x}_D(t)$ \n",
    "    so that all points along the path are reachable.  How finely do you need to discretize\n",
    "    the path so that the configuration space path, when interpolated, deviates from $\\V{x}_D(t)$ \n",
    "    no more than 1mm?  Now input a path that goes unreachable.  What happens to the configurations\n",
    "    as you approach the limit?"
