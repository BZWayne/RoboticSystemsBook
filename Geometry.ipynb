    "### Surface Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface representations (also known as *boundary representations*, or\n",

    "represent non-volumetric quantities. For example, a triangle floating in\n",
    "space, or two intersecting triangles are both valid triangle meshes, but\n",

    "does truly bound a volume is known as *watertight*. Non-watertight\n",
    "meshes are also known as *polygon soup*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volumetric Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumetric representations have the main advantage of being able to\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Quadtrees / octrees: a hierarchical 2D / 3D data structure that\n",

    "All grid-based representations are defined over a volume, usually an\n",
    "axis-aligned bounding box with corners $\\V{l}$, $\\V{u}$. The grid will\n",
    "have size $m \\times n \\times p$, and converting between world space and\n",
    "grid space requires a shift and a scale. In particular, the cell indices\n",
    "$(i,j,k)$ are determined by a transform $$\\begin{split}\n",
    "i &= \\lfloor m (x_1 - l_1) / (u_1 - l_1) \\rfloor \\\\\n",

    "which returns the largest integer less than or equal to its argument.\n",
    "(Here we assume zero-based indices.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Point-based Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Point-based representations are widely used in robotics to represent\n",
    "environment geometries because they are the type of data directly\n",
    "produced by depth sensors. These representations store a sampling of\n",
    "points $\\V{p}_1,\\ldots,\\V{p}_N$ from the geometry surface $\\partial G$.\n",
    "Individual points may be associated with colors, normals, and other\n",
    "information. Usually, this sampling is highly incomplete, exhibiting\n",
    "irregular density or large gaps caused by occlusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major types of point-based representations: *point clouds*\n",
    "and *depth images* (aka range images). A point cloud is simply an\n",
    "unstructured list of points with no assumption of regularity. Points are\n",
    "not a priori identified to objects, nor to each other. This type of\n",
    "representation results from moving lidar sensors and naïvely merged\n",
    "depth scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "A depth image is a 2D grayscale image indicating the distance from the\n",
    "camera sensor to the surface observed by each pixel. (Some invalid dpeth\n",
    "value, such as 0 or $\\infty$, indicates no data is available at that\n",
    "pixel). This is the raw form of data returned from depth cameras. The\n",
    "advantage of this form of representation over point clouds is that\n",
    "nearness in the image implies some notion of spatial proximity in 3D\n",
    "space; furthermore, the line between the camera's focal point and the\n",
    "read point must be free of other geometry. Algorithms can exploit this\n",
    "knowledge for faster geometric operations, which we shall see when we\n",
    "return to the topic of 3D mapping. Knowledge about the camera's position\n",
    "and orientation in space is required to correlate the 2D image to 3D\n",
    "points in a global reference frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both point clouds and depth images will be, in general, imperfect\n",
    "representations of geometry due to sensor noise, occlusion, and limited\n",
    "field-of-view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy Tradeoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for geometric primitives, each representation can represent\n",
    "geometry at various levels of *resolution*, such as the density of\n",
    "triangles in a triangle mesh, or the size of voxel cells in an occupancy\n",
    "grid. The choice of representation and its resolution should be chosen\n",
    "to balance several competing demands:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Fidelity to the true geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Appropriateness to desired geometric operations\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Computational complexity of geometric operations\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Difficulty of acquisition / creation\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Implementation complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Storage and transmission speed requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss several of these aspects below. In terms of fidelity,\n",
    "however, we can see some general trends. First, 3D surface\n",
    "representations (e.g., triangle meshes, point clouds) typically need\n",
    "$O(1/h^2)$ elements to achieve an approximation error of $h$ to a given\n",
    "surface. Volumetric representations based on a 3D grid will require\n",
    "$O(1/h^3)$ grid cells, which can be a substantial burden: consider\n",
    "dividing a 5 m $\\times$ 5 m $\\times$ 5 m room into centimeter-sized\n",
    "cells: $500\\times 500 \\times 500 = 125$ million cells would be needed!\n",
    "On the other hand, assuming the surface area of the object is\n",
    "approximately 5 m $\\times$ 5 m, a surface-based representation would\n",
    "only need about 25,000 elements to represent the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of more advanced data structures like octrees can compress the\n",
    "space complexity of volumetric representation to nearly $O(1/h^2)$, but\n",
    "at the expense of increased complexity of implementing geometric\n",
    "operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision Queries\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of geometric operation we shall investigate is that of\n",
    "collision detection. A *collision query* asks whether two geometries,\n",
    "$A$ and $B$, overlap; that is, whether $\\exists \\V{x} \\in A$ such that\n",
    "$\\V{x} \\in B$. We will describe how collision queries are implemented\n",
    "for a small number of geometry representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inside-outside (containment) tests\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic geometric operation is to test whether a point $\\V{x}$ is\n",
    "contained within a geometry $G$. This is a straightforward operation for\n",
    "primitives and volumetric representations, but not as straightforward\n",
    "for surface representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For primitives like spheres, containment can be tested directly from the\n",
    "mathematical expression of the primitive. For example, a ball with\n",
    "center $\\V{c}$ and radius $r$ is defined by:\n",
    "$$\\| \\V{x} - \\V{c} \\| \\leq r.\n",
    "\\label{eq:SphereContainment}$$ An oriented box with coordinate frame $T$\n",
    "and dimensions $w \\times h \\times d$ contains all points whose local\n",
    "coordinates lie in the axis-aligned box\n",
    "$[0,w] \\times [0,h] \\times [0,d]$; hence the test for whether a\n",
    "world-space point lies inside is simply the test:\n",
    "$$T^{-1} \\V{x} \\in [0,w] \\times [0,h] \\times [0,d].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumetric representations also lend themselves to fast containment\n",
    "testing. Grids have O(1) containment testing by converting the point to\n",
    "grid coordinates and then retrieving the contents of the identified grid\n",
    "cell. Octrees containment testing is typically logarithmic in the number\n",
    "of grid cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface representations are more challenging since there is no explicit\n",
    "representation of the object's interior. If it is known that a surface\n",
    "representation is watertight, then it is possible to *count* the number\n",
    "of intersections between the surface and a ray whose origin is $\\V{x}$\n",
    "and direction is arbitrary. If the number of intersections is odd, then\n",
    "the point is inside; otherwise it is outside. (There is, however, some\n",
    "subtlety when the ray lies directly tangential to the surface, that must\n",
    "be handled when creating a robust algorithm.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision Detection Between Primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions between geometric primitives can be computed through\n",
    "closed-form O(1) expressions. We shall give a couple definitions here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision between spheres with centers $\\V{c}_1$ and $\\V{c}_2$ and\n",
    "respective radii $r_1$ and $r_2$ occurs when the distance between the\n",
    "two centers is no larger than the sum of the radii:\n",
    "$$\\| \\V{c}_1 - \\V{c}_2 \\| \\leq r_1 + r_2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision between a sphere and an infinite line can be tested by\n",
    "determining whether the closest point on the line to the sphere's center\n",
    "falls inside the sphere. Suppose the sphere has center $\\V{c}$ and\n",
    "radius $r$, and the line is given by two points on the line $\\V{a}$ and\n",
    "$\\V{b}$. Then, the closest point $\\V{p}$ to the center is determined\n",
    "through projection of $\\V{c}$ onto the line:\n",
    "$$\\V{p} = \\V{a} + (\\V{b} - \\V{a})\\frac{(\\V{c} - \\V{a}) \\cdot (\\V{b} - \\V{a})}{\\| \\V{b} - \\V{a} \\|^2}.$$\n",
    "Then, containment of $\\V{p}$ is determined\n",
    "through ($\\ref{eq:SphereContainment}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision between a sphere and a line segment with endpoints $\\V{a}$ and\n",
    "$\\V{b}$ is similar, but we must handle the case in which the closest\n",
    "point from $\\V{c}$ to the line defining the segment outside of the\n",
    "endpoints. Notice that the scalar parameter determined by projection\n",
    "$$u = \\frac{(\\V{c} - \\V{a}) \\cdot (\\V{b} - \\V{a})}{\\| \\V{b} - \\V{a} \\|^2}$$\n",
    "defines what fraction $\\V{p}$ interpolates between $\\V{a}$ and $\\V{b}$.\n",
    "To restrain $\\V{p}$ to the line segment, we can limit $u$ to the range\n",
    "$[0,1]$. In other words, we compute whether the sphere contains the\n",
    "point:\n",
    "$$\\V{p} = \\V{a} + (\\V{b} - \\V{a})\\max\\left(0,\\min \\left(1,\\frac{(\\V{c} - \\V{a}) \\cdot (\\V{b} - \\V{a})}{\\| \\V{b} - \\V{a} \\|^2}\\right)\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2D, the collision point between two line segments, defined\n",
    "respectively by endpoints $\\V{a}_1$ and $\\V{b}_1$ and endpoints\n",
    "$\\V{a}_2$ and $\\V{b}_2$ can be determined as follows. First, determine\n",

    "\n",
    "### Bounding Volume Hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "For more complex, non-convex representations like triangle meshes, the\n",
    "approach of checking each pair of primitives defining the objects is\n",
    "prohibitively expensive. Instead, hierarchical geometric data structures\n",
    "known as bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) are used to accelerate\n",
    "collision detection as well as other geometric operations. The approach\n",
    "consists of two general ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, portions of a geometry can be bounded by simple primitive\n",
    "bounding volumes (BVs), which provides a quick-reject test to eliminate\n",
    "more expensive computations. Suppose it is known that geometry $A$ lies\n",
    "entirely within a sphere $S_A$ and $B$ lies within a sphere $S_B$. Then,\n",
    "if $S_A$ and $S_B$ do not overlap, it is certain that $A$ and $B$ do not\n",
    "overlap. Spheres and (oriented) boxes are commonly used as primitive\n",
    "BVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, a \"divide and conquer\" approach can be used where if two\n",
    "top-level BVs overlap, we can divide the two model into portions that\n",
    "are themselves contained within smaller BVs. This division is performed\n",
    "recursively, leading to smaller and smaller portions of the model until\n",
    "individual primitives are left. The BVH stores all of these BVs in a\n",
    "hierarchical data structure (a tree) with the top level bounding volume\n",
    "(the root) containing the entire model, and the lowest level (the\n",
    "leaves) containing individual primitives. The BVH is precomputed for a\n",
    "given model and then reused during collision detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check collision between two BVHs, the following operations are\n",
    "performed recursively, starting at the root BVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If the two BVs do not overlap, return \"no collision\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If the two BVs are leaves, test their contents for collision. If a\n",
    "    collision exists, return \"collision\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Otherwise, pick one of the BVs and recurse on both of its children.\n",
    "    If either call returns \"collision\", then return \"collision\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In step 3, a simple heuristic is to choose the larger of the two BVs.\n",
    "Furthermore, we should choose which child to recurse on first in order\n",
    "to find a collision faster, if one exists. (If the objects collide,\n",
    "recursing on the correct child first may eliminate unnecessary\n",
    "computation with the second child; if they don't collide, both children\n",
    "will need to be checked anyway.) One such heuristic is to start with the\n",
    "child with the greatest volume of overlap with the un-split BV.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is implemented in several widely used collision detection\n",
    "packages, such as PQP and FCL. Computational performance is generally\n",
    "quite good: on modern PCs, millions of collision checks can be performed\n",
    "per second between meshes consisting of thousands of triangles. However,\n",
    "the computation cost does vary with the spatial proximity of the\n",
    "objects. If the objects are far from each other, the algorithm is quite\n",
    "fast because only the top level BVs will be checked. If the objects are\n",
    "highly overlapping, then the heuristic will likely lead the search to\n",
    "find a collision quickly, and typically takes logarithmic time. The most\n",
    "expensive case is when the objects have many primitives that are very\n",
    "close to colliding, but not quite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since BVHs are precomputed, it is important to consider what happens\n",
    "when a geometry changes. It would be quite computationally expensive to\n",
    "recompute a BVH for each query. However, if a geometry moves according\n",
    "to a rigid transform, we could reuse the precomputed BVH with the\n",
    "implicit understanding that the true geometry has moved; in other words,\n",
    "we delay transforming any primitive or bounding volume until just before\n",
    "each geometric operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-rigid deformations, it is more expensive to use BVHs since the\n",
    "BVs of portions of the object must be recomputed. There do exist methods\n",
    "to modify BVs for relatively small deformations, but it is harder to\n",
    "develop efficiently updated, compact BVHs under larger deformations such\n",
    "as in cloths and ropes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broad Phase Collision Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The above discussions applied only to pairs of geometries. If $n$\n",
    "objects are moving simultaneously, then it may be quite expensive to\n",
    "check all $n(n-1)/2$ pairs ($O(n^2)$ time). The process of eliminating\n",
    "pairs of objects from consideration, before performing more detailed\n",
    "collision checking, is known as *broad phase collision detection* and\n",
    "can lead to major performance improvements when $n$ is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple method for broad phase collision detection is a *spatial\n",
    "grid* method, and is most applicable for objects of relatively similar\n",
    "size. Assume that all objects have diameter $d$, and relatively few\n",
    "objects overlap. Then, we can construct a grid where each cell has\n",
    "dimensions $d \\times d \\times d$, and each cell contains a list of\n",
    "objects whose center lies inside it. This grid can be constructed in\n",
    "$O(n)$ time, particularly when using a sparse data structure like a hash\n",
    "table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to query for collisions, we loop through all grid cells, and only\n",
    "check collision between objects contained in a cell and each neighboring\n",
    "cell (for a total of 9 cells in 2D and 27 cells in 3D). If the number of\n",
    "objects whose center lies in a grid cell is bounded by a constant, then\n",
    "all pairs of potentially colliding objects can be determined in $O(n)$\n",
    "time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to be able to visualize geometric models, and the chosen\n",
    "representation does effect the performance, realism, and clarity of a\n",
    "visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rasterization\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic operation performed by commodity graphics cards is known as\n",
    "*rasterization*, in which triangles are drawn, pixel by pixel, into the\n",
    "image shown on a computer screen. To use rasterization for non-triangle\n",
    "mesh data, the particular representation must be converted to triangle\n",
    "mesh form. Methods for doing so will be discussed when we cover\n",
    "[geometric conversions](#geometric-conversions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For optimal performance, static or rigidly transforming triangle meshes\n",
    "should be uploaded to the computer's graphics processing unit (GPU).\n",
    "Deforming triangle meshes require data to be transferred to the GPU,\n",
    "which incurs a performance penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colors, lighting, shadowing, textures, and other visual effects may be\n",
    "applied as well to obtain more realistic-looking results. However, each\n",
    "triangle is rasterized sequentially into the image buffer, and effects\n",
    "like transparency and shadowing require carefully designed rasterization\n",
    "pipelines. Designing such pipelines is beyond the scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volumetric rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common method for visualizing volumetric geometries is to\n",
    "convert the volume to a surface representation and use rasterization\n",
    "techniques. However, it is worth mentioning some other methods for\n",
    "visualizing volumetric data developed for scientific visualization and\n",
    "computer graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ray-casting* methods imagine a ray emanating from each pixel in the\n",
    "screen, and march along through space until a surface is hit. The method\n",
    "is used in computer graphics to render shadows and transparency, as well\n",
    "as for volumetric rendering. Complex visual phenomena like absorption,\n",
    "scattering, and self-shadowing can be simulated using these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Volumetric texturing* methods treat the volume as a 3D texture and\n",
    "rasterize slices through the volume. This approach makes advanced use of\n",
    "modern GPUs to obtain faster frame rates than ray-casting methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Point cloud visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Point clouds can be somewhat challenging to visualize sensibly because\n",
    "the data is distributed with non-uniform sparsity, with missing patches\n",
    "due to occlusion, and spurious noise. If color information is\n",
    "unavailable, simply rasterizing points tends to obscure shape due to the\n",
    "lack of visual cues like lighting. As a result a point cloud,\n",
    "particularly when viewed from oblique angles, will look fairly strange,\n",
    "and will display portions of the objects that should be hidden from\n",
    "view.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of techniques have been developed to make point cloud\n",
    "visualization more interpretable, such as false color, which encoding\n",
    "$x$, $y$, $z$ position as some sort of color; billboarding which\n",
    "visualizes a small patch of geometry like a square or disk at each\n",
    "point; or splatting, which fills in space between points to make the\n",
    "image appear like a solid object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric Conversions\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that some geometric operations are more suited to certain\n",
    "representations than others, it is often necessary to perform\n",
    "conversions between representations. It is also often necessary to\n",
    "perform modifications to an existing representation for purposes of\n",
    "computational efficiency, or limitations of storage / transmission\n",
    "channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surface to Triangle Mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternate surface representations are often converted to triangle meshes\n",
    "for visualization, collision queries, and compatibility. Parameterized\n",
    "surfaces can be converted to triangle meshes by defining a grid in\n",
    "parameter space, and computing triangles connecting the points on the\n",
    "grid. The resolution of the grid should be chosen carefully to balance\n",
    "computational complexity and geometric fidelity requirements.\n",
    "Subdivision surfaces maintain a polygonal mesh, and by performing\n",
    "recursive subdivision and smoothing operations, the mesh is\n",
    "progressively modified toward a limiting smooth surface. The recursion\n",
    "stops when a desired resolution level is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volume to Surface\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit surfaces are typically converted to triangle meshes by the\n",
    "*marching cubes* algorithm . First, if the implicit function is not\n",
    "already in grid form, a grid containing the geometry is defined and the\n",
    "surface evaluated on each of the grid points. Then, the algorithm\n",
    "\"marches\" along each cell, and if the function values of the 8 vertices\n",
    "of the cell contain both positive and negative values, then the 0\n",
    "isosurface passes through the cell. For cells containing the surface,\n",
    "marching cubes generates anywhere from 1 to 4 triangles within the cell\n",
    "that separate the positive and negative vertices from each other.\n",
    "Repeating this for each cell through the volume produces a watertight\n",
    "isosurface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occupancy grids are often converted to triangle meshes by outputting a\n",
    "rectangle when an occupied cell borders an unoccupied one. This has the\n",
    "effect of creating a jagged \"stair step\" appearance because each face is\n",
    "axis-aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surface to Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typically harder to convert between surface and volume\n",
    "representations due to subtle resolution issues, and furthermore when a\n",
    "surface is non-watertight it is not even clear what an appropriate\n",
    "volume should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From Surface to Distance Field\n",
    "\n",
    "In the watertight surface case, the *fast marching method* (FMM) can be\n",
    "used to produce a signed distance field . The first step of FMM is to\n",
    "define a grid containing the surface, and identify all of the surface\n",
    "cells. The signed distance from each grid vertex to the surface is then\n",
    "computed. These seed values are stored in a priority queue, ordered by\n",
    "increasing absolute distance. Additionally, each grid vertex is labeled\n",
    "as either *far*, *considered*, or *accepted*, depending on whether the\n",
    "value at that vertex is not considered yet, tentatively assigned but\n",
    "potentially changing in the future, or fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seed values are initially marked as accepted. Then, the algorithm\n",
    "proceeds to establish distance values throughout the whole volume in\n",
    "\"brush fire\" fashion, with the invariant that a vertex is only accepted\n",
    "when all possible direct paths to it from the surface have been\n",
    "considered. The iteration performs the following steps: 1) the grid\n",
    "vertex in the queue with least distance is chosen, and it is marked as\n",
    "accepted, 2) using its distance value, the distance field is\n",
    "extrapolated to its un-accepted neighbors. During step 2, far neighbors\n",
    "are marked as considered, and the distance of a considered vertex is\n",
    "modified only if the extrapolated value is less than the previously\n",
    "stored values. This continues until all vertices are accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a suitably defined queue data structure, the overall running time\n",
    "of the algorithm is $O(N \\log N)$ where $N$ is the number of grid cells.\n",
    "The major caveat with this algorithm is that the initial determination\n",
    "of inside and outside vertices is sensitive to the grid resolution, and\n",
    "if there are features of the surface smaller than the grid cell size,\n",
    "this may lead to an inconsistent propagation of inside / outside cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implicit surface fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Another class of volumetric construction methods attempts to fit an\n",
    "implicit surface function to the surface data. In one common form, an\n",
    "implicit function can be defined as a sum of $N$ *radial basis\n",
    "functions* : $$f(\\V{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^N w_j \\phi(\\| \\V{x} - \\V{c}_j \\|)$$\n",
    "where each basis function is defined by the *kernel* $\\phi$ and the\n",
    "center $\\V{c}_j$. Here $w_j$ is the weight associated with the $j$'th\n",
    "basis function. Common functions for $\\phi$ include the linear kernel\n",
    "$\\phi(r) = r$, the Gaussian kernel $\\phi(r) = e^{-b r^2}$ with $b$ a\n",
    "constant parameter, and the thin plate spline kernel\n",
    "$\\phi(r) = r^2 \\log r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are given $N$ desired function values $f_i$ at points $\\V{x}_i$,\n",
    "$i=1,\\ldots,N$, then the weights $w_1,\\ldots,w_N$ can be tuned so that\n",
    "the function meets those values: $f(\\V{x}_j) = f_j$. This fitting is\n",
    "performed by solving a linear system of equations:\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\phi(\\|\\V{x}_1 - \\V{c}_1 \\|) & \\cdots & \\phi(\\|\\V{x}_1 - \\V{c}_N \\|) \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "\\phi(\\|\\V{x}_N - \\V{c}_1 \\|) & \\cdots & \\phi(\\|\\V{x}_N - \\V{c}_N \\|) \n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}{w_1} \\\\ {\\vdots} \\\\ {w_N} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}{f_1} \\\\ {\\vdots} \\\\ {f_N} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then a matter to decide where to place the evaluation points,\n",
    "desired function values, and basis function centers. Certainly, placing\n",
    "points on the geometry surface such that $f(\\V{x})=0$ ensures that the\n",
    "implicit surface will pass through these points. However, these points\n",
    "are insufficient, because this leads to the trivial solution\n",
    "$w_1,\\ldots,w_N = 0$. An additional constraint is to keep points outside\n",
    "of the geometry to be positive, and some points inside the geometry to\n",
    "be negative. Commonly, these are points offset from the surface along\n",
    "the normal direction. To place the centers, one commonly used technique\n",
    "is to assume the evaluation points and centers shall coincide:\n",
    "$\\V{x}_i = \\V{c}_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques are susceptible to numerical difficulties when $N$ is\n",
    "large and the evaluation points are close together, since the matrix to\n",
    "be inverted becomes large and ill-conditioned. Running times also suffer\n",
    "with large $N$. More advanced approaches have been developed to overcome\n",
    "these issues, such as using basis functions that lead to a sparse\n",
    "matrix, or fitting many local implicit surfaces over local regions and\n",
    "then combining their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space carving\n",
    "\n",
    "Space carving techniques will be described in more detail when we\n",
    "discuss 3D mapping, but here we shall give a short overview. The idea is\n",
    "start with a fully occupied occupancy grid, and then to imagine taking\n",
    "views of the surface from multiple angles. For each point in the view,\n",
    "free space is \"carved\" out of the occupancy grid by marching along a ray\n",
    "emanating from the viewpoints and terminating once the object's surface\n",
    "is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "After many views are simulated, the resulting occupancy grid contains\n",
    "the object and matches its silhouette from multiple angles. It is also\n",
    "possible to modify the method slightly to define an approximate signed\n",
    "distance function. It should be noted, however, that space carving\n",
    "methods do not faithfully represent objects with interior cavities or\n",
    "deep holes that are difficult to see from a distant exterior view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Point cloud to surface\n",
    "\n",
    "Point clouds can be converted to surfaces in a few ways, but this\n",
    "operation is not trivial because it is not immediately clear simply from\n",
    "the coordinates of a set of points whether they belong to the same\n",
    "surface. As a result, each of these techniques is prone to certain\n",
    "artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For depth images, it is a simple matter to view the image as a triangle\n",
    "mesh grid and then to assign coordinates to the vertices of the mesh\n",
    "using the depth values and camera transform. Discontinuities in depth\n",
    "can be assumed to be caused by disjoint objects, and triangles\n",
    "corresponding to those discontinuities can be deleted from the mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another class of techniques first builds a volumetric representation,\n",
    "such as by implicit surface fitting or space carving, and then converts\n",
    "back to a triangle mesh using marching cubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final class of techniques attempts to build a triangle mesh directly\n",
    "from the point cloud. Some geometric criterion is used to define whether\n",
    "a particular candidate line (in 2D) or triangle (in 3D) connecting\n",
    "points should be included in the surface. Examples of such criteria are\n",
    "$\\alpha$-shapes, Delaunay triangulations, and the Voronoi diagram. These\n",
    "methods generally assume that the sampling of points on the surface is\n",
    "sufficiently dense so that, loosely speaking, surface elements are\n",
    "smaller than non-surface elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometry can be simplified in a number of ways for improved\n",
    "computational performance and compact storage / transmission. Point\n",
    "clouds and volumetric representations can be downsampled or averaged to\n",
    "obtain a coarser resolution. Triangle meshes can be simplified in a\n",
    "number of ways. Decimation collapses vertices and/or edges to obtain\n",
    "progressively fewer triangles while attempting to maintain high quality.\n",
    "Clustering methods break the mesh into pieces and then replaces the\n",
    "pieces with simplified re-meshed geometry. A mesh could also be\n",
    "converted into a volumetric representation of a given resolution, and\n",
    "then the surface could be extracted.\n",

    "\n",
    "Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The four main types of geometry representations are primitives,\n",
    "    volumes, surfaces, and points.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each representation has certain strengths and weaknesses with\n",
    "    regards to the storage complexity, time complexity, and accuracy of\n",
    "    operations that can be calculated upon them.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Collision detection can be performed using mathematical operations\n",
    "    for primitive objects, the separation principle for convex objects,\n",
    "    or bounding volume decompositions for compound objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Conversions between representations is often easiest from volume to\n",
    "    surface and from surface to points, while the reverse is much\n",
    "    harder."
