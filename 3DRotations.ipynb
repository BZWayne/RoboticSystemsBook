    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the rotation is such that the pre-rotation axes $X$, $Y$, and\n",
    "$Z$, are rotated to post-rotation axes $X^\\prime$, $Y^\\prime$, and\n",
    "$Z^\\prime$, respectively. The first column represents the coordinates of\n",

    "$$\\V{x}^\\prime = \\begin{bmatrix} r_{11} \\\\ r_{21} \\\\ r_{31} \\end{bmatrix}.$$ Similarly, the\n",

    "third column gives $\\V{z}^\\prime = (r_{13},r_{23},r_{33})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, since $R^{-1} = R^T$, the coordinates of the old frame's axes\n",
    "*relative to the new frame* are the individual rows of $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the cosine rule, $r_{11}$ is the cosine of the angle between the\n",
    "old and new $X$ axis (because it is the dot product between\n",
    "$\\V{x}^\\prime$ and $\\V{x} = (1,0,0)$. Similarly, the other diagonal\n",
    "elements give the cosine of the angle between the other axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applying rotation to a point.** As we have seen before, applying\n",
    "rotation to a point (i.e., deriving the coordinates of a rotated point\n",
    "in the original coordinate frame) is simply matrix-vector\n",
    "multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composition.** Composition between two rotation matrices $R_1$ and\n",
    "$R_2$ is simple a matrix-matrix multiplication $R_1 R_2$. Note that this\n",
    "matrix is the result of applying $R_2$ first and then $R_1$, and is not\n",
    "the same as the converse.\n",

    "Properly composing rotations can be confusing due to the convention\n",
    "chosen about whether rotation axes are considered fixed to the world\n",
    "reference frame, or rotating along with the local reference frame. In\n",
    "this class we will use the former convention, which is known as\n",
    "*extrinsic* rotation. Suppose that $R_1$ is a rotation about axis $A$\n",
    "and $R_2$ is a rotation about axis $B$. When composed to $R_1 R_2$, this\n",
    "means that a point $P$ given in local coordinates $\\V{p}$ will first get\n",
    "rotated about axis $B$ to obtain a point $P^\\prime$ and then about axis\n",
    "$A$ *where $A$ is interpreted as being fixed in the un-rotated reference\n",
    "frame* to obtain $P^{\\prime\\prime}$. The result $R_1 R_2 \\V{p}$ gives\n",
    "the coordinates of $P^{\\prime\\prime}$ relative to the un-rotated\n",
    "reference frame, as shown in [Fig. 3](#fig:RotationComposition).\n",

    "\n",
    "<div class=\"figcaption\"><a name=\"fig:RotationComposition\">Figure 3</a>. The composition $R_1\\cdot R_2$\n",
    "of two rotation matrices corresponds to\n",
    "first performing $R_2$, then performing $R_1$. This means that the\n",
    "coordinate frame represented by $R_2$ is rotated about the axis of $R_1$\n",
    "<i>in the original frame</i>.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "***************\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion often lies when axes of rotation are considered attached\n",
    "to frames already being rotated (*intrinsic* rotations), which happens\n",
    "when trying to solve problems like the following: \"Let $P$ be attached\n",
    "to a rigid body $B$ and have coordinates $(1,2,3)$ relative to $B$'s\n",

    "$B$ about its $Z$ axis by $90^\\circ$, and then by another $90^\\circ$\n",
    "about $B$'s local $X$ axis, and finally translating its origin by the\n",
    "offset $\\V{t}(10,0,5)$.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Naïvely performing each transformation in sequence produces the wrong\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The rotation $R_Z(90^\\circ)$ maps $(1,2,3)$ to $(-2,1,3)$.\n",

    "2.  The rotation $R_X(90^\\circ)$ maps $(-2,1,3)$ to $(-2,-3,1)$.\n",

    "$$R_X(90^\\circ) R_Z(90^\\circ) \\V{p} + \\V{t}$$ Instead, the key problem\n",
    "is that after the first rotation, the local $X$ axis has rotated along\n",
    "with the body, and is no longer equivalent to the $X$ axis in world\n",
    "coordinates! Instead, it is aligned with the world's $Y$ axis. The\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  The rotation $R_Z(90^\\circ)$ maps $(1,2,3)$ to $(-2,1,3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The rotation $R_Z(90^\\circ)$ also maps the local $X$ axis to the\n",
    "    world $Y$ axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The rotation $R_Y(90^\\circ)$ maps $(-2,1,3)$ to $(3,1,2)$.\n",

    "$$R_Z(90^\\circ) R_X(90^\\circ) \\V{p} + \\V{t}.$$ The reason why this\n",

    "Euler Angles\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler angles are a three-parameter representation of rotations\n",
    "$(\\phi,\\theta,\\psi)$, and are derived from the definitions of $R_X$,\n",
    "$R_Y$, and $R_Z$ above. They are one of the oldest rotation\n",
    "representations, are easy to interpret, and are also frequently used in\n",
    "aeronautics and robotics. The basic idea is to select three different\n",
    "axes and represent the rotation as a composite of three axis-aligned\n",
    "rotations. The order in which axes are chosen is a matter of convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the *roll-pitch-yaw* convention often used in aerospace\n",

    "operation first needs to figure out which sign of $p$ to assign in order\n",
    "to choose the closer way around the 4-D sphere. Specifically, if the dot\n",
    "product of $q$ and $p$, $q \\cdot p$, is negative, then the sign of each\n",
    "element of $p$ is flipped. (This step is specific to quaternion rotation\n",
    "interpolation, and skipped for general slerp on spheres.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the angle $\\theta$ between the two quaternions is computed\n",
    "according to $\\theta = \\cos^{-1} (q \\cdot p)$. Finally, the interpolated\n",
    "quaternion is given by\n",
    "$$r(s) = \\frac{\\sin ((1-s) \\theta)}{\\sin \\theta} q + \\frac{\\sin (s \\theta)}{\\sin \\theta} p.$$\n",
    "It can be shown that this is a geodesic and interpolates across the\n",
    "great circle at constant velocity."
